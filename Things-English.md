# Things to Consider When Designing a Circuit
According to my experience, these are 20 points that are good to pay attention to when designing a circuit:

1. In PCB design, first, place the components which have a certain place on the board.
2. Always use the component datasheet as the reference for your design. (most of the datasheets have circuit design examples for different use)
3. for the microcontroller circuit, development boards like Arduino, NodeMCU, Blue pill, and ... can really help(most of their design are available on the internet)
